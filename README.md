# Global Azure Bootcamp 2017 - Miami

## Parking

We just learned that you **CAN NOT** park in the Paramount lot behind Venture Hive. We're sorry about that. You can park in the paid parking lot adjacent to Venture Hive or in any of the spaces in front of Venture Hive.

## Meals

We will have Breakfast and Lunch provided. A big thanks to [Fish Angler](http://www.fishangler.com/) for providing breakfast and to Microsoft for providing lunch. In case you have any allergies, we'll have doughnuts and bagels in the morning and pizza for lunch.
